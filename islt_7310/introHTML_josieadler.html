Hi! My name is Josie Adler and I am a sophomore at the University of Missouri. I am majoring in environmental science with a focus in soil. In the future, I would like to work to mitigate the threat of climate change and protect vulnerable habitats. I am passionate about this because I have enjoyed the outdoors for all of my life. 
I do not have any previous experience with websites or applications. Therefore, I am hoping this course will get me comfortable with the basics of coding and website development. And while I am unsure where my future career will take me, I am sure that the skills I learn will be applicable.
While Iâ€™m not studying, I spend most of my free time outside, whether that is hiking, biking, kayaking, or just soaking up the sun.
